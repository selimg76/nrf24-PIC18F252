# nrf24-PIC18F252
nRF24L01+ Driver for PIC18F252 Microcontroller

First entry: 7/7/2022:
3/4 files for the TX-RX project

Use pic18f252_nrf24_main as your main c file in the project, add nrf24.h in your project as well.
The Arduino Code is either:
rc_receiver_w_servo_no_pwm   (this one is for an RC Car)
or:
receiver_nano_1_pic_tx    (simpler, only receiver, prints the output to serial monitor)

I'll be uploading a descriptive video
